# Status History in Leads Page - Complete Documentation

## Overview
The Leads page includes a comprehensive **Status History** system that tracks all status changes for each lead throughout their lifecycle. This provides complete audit trail and visibility into the sales funnel progression.

## üîç **Where to Find Status History**

### In the Leads List
Each lead card in the UnifiedLeadsList component has a **Status History button** (clock icon) that opens the status history modal.

**Location**: Right side of each lead card, next to other action buttons
**Icon**: Clock icon (‚è∞)
**Action**: Click to open the Status History Modal

## üìä **Status History Features**

### 3. **Automatic Tracking**
**Database Trigger**: Automatically logs status changes
**File**: `/database/lead-status-history.sql`

#### What's Tracked:
- **Previous Status**: What the status was before
- **New Status**: What the status changed to
- **Changed By**: Which user made the change (via auth.uid())
- **Timestamp**: Exact time of change
- **Change Reason**: Automatic reason ("Status updated via CRM system")

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema**

### Table: `consultation_request_status_history`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- consultation_request_id (UUID, Foreign Key)
- previous_status (VARCHAR(50))
- new_status (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL)
- changed_by (UUID, References auth.users)
- change_reason (TEXT)
- notes (TEXT)
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

### RPC Functions:
1. **`get_lead_status_history(lead_id UUID)`**
   - Returns complete status history for a lead
   - Ordered by creation time (newest first)

2. **`add_status_history_entry(...)`**
   - Manually add status history entries
   - Used for custom tracking scenarios

### Database Trigger:
**`track_consultation_status_change_trigger`**
- Automatically fires on consultation_requests UPDATE
- Only logs when status actually changes
- Captures user context and timestamps

## üîß **How It Works**

### 1. **Automatic Status Tracking**
When a lead status is updated through:
- QuickStatusUpdate component
- Lead conversion process
- Manual status updates via API

The database trigger automatically:
1. Detects status change
2. Captures previous and new status
3. Records user who made change
4. Timestamps the change
5. Stores in status history table

### 2. **Manual History Access**
Users can view status history by:
1. Going to Leads page
2. Finding the desired lead
3. Clicking the clock icon (‚è∞) on the lead card
4. Viewing the complete timeline in the modal

### 3. **Status History Modal Flow**
1. **Modal Opens**: Triggers `loadStatusHistory()` function
2. **Data Fetch**: Calls `LeadStatusHistoryService.getStatusHistory()`
3. **RPC Call**: Executes `get_lead_status_history()` database function
4. **Timeline Render**: Displays chronological status changes
5. **Interactive Elements**: Shows details, reasons, and user info
